# USB-C-5V-Power-Supply-Project-V1

This project was one of my first exercise in designing and manufacturing a small, functional printed circuit board (PCB). The goal was simple but essential: create a basic 5V USB-C power supply outputting through a reliable connector. I focused on correctly handling USB-C negotiation for 5V output and building a clean, compact starting point for future, more complex projects.
